# FACE DETECTION & RECOGNITION 
Face detection involves identifying a person’s face in an image or video. This is done by analyzing the visual input to determine whether a person’s facial features are present.
Since human faces are so diverse, face detection models typically need to be trained on large amounts of input data for them to be accurate.
The training dataset must contain a sufficient representation of people who come from different backgrounds, genders, and cultures.
These algorithms also need to be fed many training samples comprising different lighting, angles, and orientations to make correct predictions in real-world scenarios.
